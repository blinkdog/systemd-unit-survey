## Inspirational quotes
"It's like an express train full of things designed to hurt your mind.
Just when you think that it's finished running you over, and the last
train car of stupid starts receding into the distance, another hits
you, grinding another chunk of brain cells beneath its wheels." -
Darren MacLennan
